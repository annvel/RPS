Rock Paper Scissors Game

This project is part of my The Odin Project projects.
It is a game of rock paper scissors which in the early stages, will only run in the console of a browser. 
Later updates will have a GUI which will run on a webpage.

An external js file (main.js) will be linked to the html file (index.html).
Later, index.html structure will be coded.
